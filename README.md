## ✨ Motivation

As a software engineer and maker hobbyist, I love OpenSCAD. It allows for precision and maps to my mental model of building things. However, some operations (like rounding with `minkowski`) are not very intuitive. At work, I often use Cursor and Claude Code for writing code, and found myself plugging my OpenSCAD code into ChatGPT in order to either (1) scaffold out a starting point or (2) fix a confusing issue in my code. I also became frustrated by certain limitations of the OpenSCAD editor, like not being able to easily indent code with the editor commands I'm used to. So I built OpenSCAD Studio, which aims to be something like a Cursor for the language.

## Features

- 🌐 **Web app** - Use directly in your browser at [openscad-studio.pages.dev](https://openscad-studio.pages.dev) — no install needed
- 🤖 **AI copilot** - Chat with Claude/GPT to generate and fix code (bring your own API key)
- 🎨 **Modern editor** - OpenSCAD syntax highlighting, multi-tab editing, format on save, vim mode support
- 📐 **2D mode** - Dedicated SVG viewer for laser cutting and engraving
- 🖼️ **Live 3D preview** - Interactive mesh viewer with orbit controls and content-hash caching
- 🔍 **Real-time diagnostics** - Inline error markers with line/column precision
- ⚙️ **Customizer panel** - Interactive controls for OpenSCAD parameters with auto-rendering
- 🌈 **22+ themes** - Popular themes like Catppuccin, Dracula, One Dark Pro, GitHub, Nord, Tokyo Night, and more

**Limitations:** Special operators (!, #, %, \*) preview not yet implemented

## 📦 Installation

### Web (No Install)

Visit **[openscad-studio.pages.dev](https://openscad-studio.pages.dev)**. Works in Chrome and Edge (requires SharedArrayBuffer support). No OpenSCAD installation needed — rendering is done via WebAssembly in your browser.

### Desktop (macOS)

Install via Homebrew:

```bash
brew tap zacharyfmarion/openscad-studio
brew install --cask openscad-studio
```

Or download the latest DMG from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/zacharyfmarion/openscad-studio/releases). Requires macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or later.

### Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run web version in development mode
pnpm web:dev

# Run desktop version in development mode (requires Rust toolchain)
pnpm tauri:dev

# Build for production
pnpm web:build    # Web
pnpm tauri:build  # Desktop
```

Desktop development requires the [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/). Web development only needs Node.js 18+ and pnpm.

## 🤖 AI Copilot Setup

The AI copilot uses the [Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/) with streaming support. API keys are stored locally — in your browser's localStorage for the web version, or in Tauri's encrypted store for the desktop app.

1. Open Settings (⌘,)
2. Navigate to "AI" tab
3. Enter your Anthropic / OpenAI API key

**Supported Providers:**
All models from the following providers are supported:

- Anthropic
- OpenAI

The AI can:

- View your current code and preview
- Make targeted code changes
- Check for compilation errors
- Generate new OpenSCAD designs from natural language

## 📚 Documentation

- **[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)** - Comprehensive guide for AI assistants and contributors
- **[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Web + desktop architecture design
- **[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)** - Detailed development roadmap with phases

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- ✅ **Phase 1-2**: Monaco editor, live preview, 3D viewer, export, caching
- ✅ **Phase 3**: AI copilot
- ✅ **Phase 4 (Partial)**: Production polish, customizer, themes, CI/CD
- ✅ **Phase 5 (v0.7)**: Web version with openscad-wasm

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for detailed breakdown.
