# Contributing to OpenSCAD Studio

Thank you for your interest in contributing to OpenSCAD Studio! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

**Development Tools:**

- Node.js 18+ and pnpm
- Rust toolchain 1.82+ (only needed for desktop development)
- Git

### Initial Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/zacharyfmarion/openscad-studio.git
cd openscad-studio

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run web version in development mode
pnpm web:dev

# Run desktop version in development mode (requires Rust)
pnpm tauri:dev
```

## 📝 Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy

- `main` - Production-ready code
- `feature/your-feature-name` - Feature branches
- `fix/issue-number-description` - Bug fix branches

### Making Changes

1. **Create a new branch** from `main`:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following our code style guidelines

3. **Test your changes**:

   ```bash
   # Type check
   pnpm type-check

   # Lint
   pnpm lint

   # Build (web)
   pnpm web:build

   # Run web app
   pnpm web:dev

   # Run desktop app (requires Rust)
   pnpm tauri:dev
   ```

4. **Commit your changes** using conventional commits:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
   ```

5. **Push and create a pull request**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## 🎨 Code Style

### TypeScript/React

- Use functional components with hooks (no class components)
- Prefer `const` over `let`
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Use async/await over raw promises
- Extract complex logic into custom hooks

**Example:**

```typescript
// Good
export function MyComponent({ value }: { value: string }) {
  const [state, setState] = useState('');

  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
    setState(value);
  }, [value]);

  return <button onClick={handleClick}>{state}</button>;
}

// Avoid
class MyComponent extends React.Component { ... }
```

### Rust (Desktop Only)

- Follow `rustfmt` defaults
- Use `Result<T, E>` for error handling
- Document public APIs with doc comments
- Prefer `async` functions for I/O operations

## 📋 Commit Message Convention

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

- ✨ `feat:` New feature
- 🐛 `fix:` Bug fix
- 📝 `docs:` Documentation changes
- ♻️ `refactor:` Code restructuring without feature changes
- ✅ `test:` Adding or updating tests
- 🎨 `style:` Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- ⚡ `perf:` Performance improvements
- 🔧 `chore:` Build process or tooling changes

**Examples:**

```bash
feat: add 2D SVG preview mode
fix: resolve Monaco editor line number sync issue
docs: update README with installation instructions
refactor: extract render caching logic to separate module
```

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

Currently, the project uses manual testing. When contributing:

1. **Test your changes manually** with the checklist:
   - [ ] Feature works as expected
   - [ ] No console errors
   - [ ] No TypeScript errors
   - [ ] Works on your target platform (macOS/Windows/Linux)

2. **Test edge cases**:
   - [ ] Empty files
   - [ ] Large files (>1000 lines)
   - [ ] OpenSCAD errors
   - [ ] Invalid user input

3. **When adding automated tests** (future):
   - Place unit tests next to source files
   - Place integration tests in `tests/` directory
   - Use descriptive test names
